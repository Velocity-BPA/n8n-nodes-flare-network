# Automate Flare Network Operations with Our New n8n Community Node

We're excited to announce the release of our latest community node for n8n: **n8n-nodes-flare-network**. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, the Flare Network has emerged as a powerful platform for decentralized data and asset management. However, integrating Flare's capabilities into automated workflows has been a challenge—until now.

## The Problem We're Solving

Developers and businesses working with Flare Network often need to monitor FTSO price feeds, manage delegations, interact with FAssets, or query the State Connector. Traditionally, this requires custom coding, API integrations, and maintaining complex scripts. For teams using n8n for workflow automation, there hasn't been a native way to incorporate Flare Network operations into their processes.

## Introducing n8n-nodes-flare-network

Velocity BPA has developed this community node to bridge the gap between n8n's powerful automation capabilities and Flare Network's innovative blockchain features. This node brings first-class Flare Network support directly into your n8n workflows.

## Key Features

- **FTSO Price Feeds**: Access real-time price data from Flare Time Series Oracles directly in your workflows
- **Delegation Management**: Automate delegation operations and monitor rewards
- **FAssets Integration**: Interact with Flare's FAssets protocol for cross-chain asset management
- **State Connector Access**: Query and verify cross-chain data through Flare's State Connector

Whether you're building DeFi applications, creating monitoring dashboards, or automating portfolio management, this node enables you to incorporate Flare Network data and operations seamlessly into your n8n automations.

## Getting Started

Installing the node is simple. In your n8n instance, run:


npm install n8n-nodes-flare-network


After installation, restart n8n, and you'll find the Flare Network node available in your node palette. The node is fully documented with examples to help you get started quickly.

## Open Source and Community-Driven

This node is open source and available on GitHub at [https://github.com/Velocity-BPA/n8n-nodes-flare-network](https://github.com/Velocity-BPA/n8n-nodes-flare-network). We welcome contributions, feedback, and feature requests from the community.
